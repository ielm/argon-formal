# Theorem 1: Stratified Fixpoint Convergence

## Statement

Given a finite set of concepts with a specialization DAG, a finite set of
meta-property axes with an acyclic dependency DAG, and for each axis a set
of Category 1 (positive propagation) and Category 2 (negation-as-failure)
rules:

1. The stratified fixpoint **terminates**.
2. The result is **unique** (independent of rule application order within
   a stratum).
3. The result is **stable** (no rule application would change any
   assignment).

## Proof Strategy

Process axes in topological order (guaranteed by acyclicity). For each
axis:
- Run all Cat1 rules to fixpoint (monotone on finite domain → terminates
  by Knaster-Tarski).
- Run all Cat2 rules to fixpoint (reads completed Cat1 state, monotone
  within its stratum).

No cross-stratum feedback because the dependency graph is acyclic: each
stratum's rules only read from already-completed lower strata.

The key insight: although the full IS/CAN/NOT ordering is not a lattice
(IS ⊔ NOT is undefined), each INDIVIDUAL stratum's computation IS
monotone because:
- Cat1 only produces IS (moving CAN → IS is monotone)
- Cat2 only produces NOT (moving CAN → NOT is monotone)
- Neither Cat1 nor Cat2 changes determined values

On a finite domain, a monotone operator has a least fixpoint reached in
finitely many steps.

/-- **Theorem 1.2: Uniqueness.** The stratified fixpoint result is independent
of the topological order chosen, as long as the order is a valid topological
sort of the axis dependency graph.

## Proof outline (the four lemmas)

1. `processStratum` for axis `a` modifies only positions `(c, a)`. Follows
   from the `axis_local` field on every `MonotoneRule` and `NafRule`.

2. `processStratum` for distinct axes commute:
   `processStratum a (processStratum b s) = processStratum b (processStratum a s)`
   for `a ≠ b`. Follows from (1) — each only modifies its own axis.

3. Any two valid topological sorts of the same stratification can be
   transformed into each other by a sequence of adjacent transpositions
   that swap unrelated axes.

4. By induction on the number of transpositions and (2), the fold result
   is invariant.

The full mechanization requires `Fin`-indexed permutation reasoning over
`List.foldl` plus the commutativity lemma. The argument is classical
(it's the standard "permutation invariance under stratified evaluation"
result for stratified Datalog — see Apt, Blair & Walker 1988); the Lean
proof is mechanical-but-substantial. We axiomatize it here pending
mechanization, with `#print axioms` audit available downstream. -/

    (_hvalid1 : IsTopoSort rs.strat sort1)
    (_hvalid2 : IsTopoSort rs.strat sort2) :
    stratifiedFixpoint rs sort1 State.initial = stratifiedFixpoint rs sort2 State.initial

/-- **Theorem 1.3: Stability.** The result is a fixpoint — no rule
application would change any assignment.

## Proof outline

For axis `a` at stratum k, `processStratum` first runs Cat1 to fixpoint,
then applies Cat2.

- **Cat1 stability**: `iterateToFixpoint` ran Cat1 rules until stable.
  After Cat2 runs for axis `a`, the Cat1 rules for axis `a` see the same
  state on axis `a` (Cat2 only changes CAN → NOT; Cat1 only reads IS
  values). So Cat1 is still stable.

- **Cat2 stability**: Cat2 checks absence of IS values. After Cat1
  fixpoint, no more IS values appear for axis `a`. Cat2's NOT
  conclusions remain valid after Cat2 runs.

- For axes processed LATER (stratum > k): their rules don't modify axis
  `a` (by `axis_local`). So `a`'s stability is preserved.

Mechanization requires Cat1+Cat2 commutation reasoning across the full
fold. The argument is classical for stratified Datalog (Apt-Blair-Walker
1988; Knaster-Tarski applied per stratum); we axiomatize the per-program
result here. -/

/-! ## Key Lemma: Monotone Composition on Finite Domains -/

/-- On a finite domain, a monotone inflationary operator reaches its
fixpoint in at most `numCan State.initial` steps.

An operator `f` is inflationary if `s ≤ f s` for all `s`. Cat1 rules are
inflationary: they only ADD IS values.

## Proof

Strong induction on `numCan s`: at each non-fixpoint step `s ≠ f s`, the
information ordering plus `s ≤ f s` (from inflation) forces at least one
CAN cell to become determined, so `numCan (f s) < numCan s`. The chain
must therefore reach a fixpoint within `numCan State.initial` iterations.

This is the Knaster-Tarski theorem applied to a finite poset (Knaster
1928; Tarski 1955), specialized to the IS/CAN/NOT lattice via the
`numCan` measure.

The auxiliary `monotone_inflationary_fixpoint_from_state` is the strong
form: from any starting state, a fixpoint is reached. The headline
theorem instantiates with `State.initial`. -/

/-- **Iterate yields the least fixpoint.**

Starting from `s` and iterating a monotone-inflationary operator any
number of times keeps the result below every fixpoint above `s`. So if
the iteration reaches its own fixpoint, that fixpoint is the least
fixpoint above `s`.

This is the load-bearing lemma for `extension_monotone`: if
`F₁ = cat1Fixpoint rs₁ s` and `F₂ = cat1Fixpoint rs₂ s` and `rs₁ ⊆ rs₂`,
then `F₂` is *also* a fixpoint of `composeMonotone rs₁` above `s` (a
fact proved separately), and this lemma then gives `F₁ ≤ F₂`. -/
